# Python_Avanzado
Files of classes of the course 'Advanced Python' in UNED. Includes OOP, NLP, Image processing and ML.

The classes given by the teacher are in the Classes folder. The Documentos_finales_profe contains the final files uploaded by the teacher in case someone missed something during class. Finally, my codes are stored in the Tareas (Tasks) folder, ordered by thematic days:
- **Day 1**: OOP and Relational databases
- **Day 2**: NLP and Image processing (including a bit of ML)
- **Day 3**: Machine Learning

El sentiment_dataset.csv requerido para las practicas de NLP del dia 2 es demasiado grande. Puede descargarse de https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140.
